## minutes

- austin:
  - started this couple months back to give opportunity for ppl to learn about p2p infra
  - ppl may want to support group of friends, a community... group to help each other get started
  - start with small niche - how to start a ssb pub
  - before holidays, did some roadmap proposal over holidays
- round of intro
  - austin (punkmonk):
  - greg: atlanta, georgia, background in IT infra, got interested in meshnets to help smaller communities, went to battlemesh
  - yurko: tomesh, unsuccessful in toronto to build an actual meshnet, but been building lots of software, dweb packages with rpi, background is a hacker at heart :)
  - ben: worked in hardware, software, and more recently: community organising and literacy stuff. lots of techie interest but it's hard to communicate outside of our circles. worked with internet archive previously on dweb camp 2019, documented that over the holidays
  - glyph: cape town, south africa, peachcloud based on rpi, mushroom biz (overlap between mycology + p2p tech) bridging technical and human layers
  - david: toronto, joined video call, want to know what's involved in setting up a mesh node
  - erik: friend of david also from toronto
  - mauve: ottawa, want gorilla mesh network, rpi mesh in city bridge off public wifi totally legal (tm), explore mesh interplay with augmented reality
  - hank: tomesh, currently in design school
- roadmap github issue -> https://github.com/austinfrey/p2p-community-infrastructure/issues/4
  - everyone takes 2 min to read over...
  - hank:
    - tomesh has not had a lot of quick wins
    - plugs tomesh workshop https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/
    - can run these workshops
  - mauve:
    - like this roadmap
    - how to make it cheap
    - expensive will be big barrier to a lot of communities (e.g. cloud provider)
    - somewhere to track cost
  - yurko:
    - librerouter about $175 each
    - orangepi $10 (weird failures)
    - usually cheap -> bad hardware
    - MR16 is lucky $400 hardware gets revived for $10 a pop
  - austin:
    - hardware to suite community needs
  - ben: cost grow with community intimacy
  - yurko: manage expectations
  - mauve: what are the differences between different hardware, repurpose existing hardware, or need homogenized hardware
    - hank: may have super bottlenecks (e.g. tiny orangepi becomes bottleneck)
    - yurko:
      - wireless mesh example
      - wifi is like this chat, with one person talking at a time
      - off-the-shelf router to create a meshnet, they can't go very far
      - librerouter addresses issue that very few home routers can be configured to do (multiple radios)
    - hank: not great experience (at scale) with off the shelf cheap hardware
    - ben: think about interoperatability (allow us to start with cheap hardware and upgrade capacity as community grows), support each other's experiment
    - austin: support working groups of specialized interest
- austin: back to roadmap, do things look out of order here?
  - ben: write for a known audience ready to adopt
  - austin: we don't have a narrow focus in our roadmap, want to make something for someone
  - glyph: online gatherings for Q&A and get that started in the short term
    - some use cases in mind
  - greg: things set up for beginners setting up for communities
    - tech jargon hard to get started for ppl
    - 3 groups by level
- ben (to greg): what can unblock you to next step?
  - greg: how do you connect routers and configure them? what apps you can use, ssb, or what? workshop overview of what all these entail
  - greg: ppl who are here alrdy have a use case they know how to address
  - glyph: like greg said, beginner/intermediate/advanced for pairing up (austin, ben: +1)
- hank: mesh problem - marketing, productization problem, librerouter is a good step but a little cost prohibitive for some
  - pair up with general mesh community
  - but also limited number of experts with limited time
- austin: prepare ppl not just to use, but also ppl to teach these things
- ben: p2p learning and use those interactions as a way to create permanent documentation, over time:
  - more ppl are able to teach things
  - teaching becomes easier as permanent documentation matures
- ben: add reflections and comments on github
- hank: toronto ppl! join tomesh chat!!
- glyph: we conducted a survey of pub operators (17 respondents) should have a summary soon!
  - also, how do we keep each other informed of the work we are doing?

## next steps

- austin: move roadmap to PR
- continue the discussion
  - chat.tomesh.net
  - scuttlebutt (#communityinfra)
  - github issues
- ben emailed chat info to ppl who wanted the info
